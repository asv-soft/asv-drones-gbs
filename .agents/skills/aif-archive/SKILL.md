# Archive — Move completed plans and roadmap snapshots

Archive completed single-file plans and ultra bundle directories from
`paths.plans/` into `paths.archive/plans/` and
optionally trim closed milestones from `ROADMAP.md` into dated snapshots
under `paths.archive/roadmap/`.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Config

Read `.ai-factory/config.yaml` if it exists to resolve:

- `paths.plans` (default: `.ai-factory/plans/`)
- `paths.archive` (default: `.ai-factory/archive/`)
- `paths.plan` (default: `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`)
- `paths.fix_plan` (default: `.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md`)
- `paths.roadmap` (default: `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md`)
- `workflow.plan_id_format` (default: `slug`) — active values: `slug` and
  `sequential`. `timestamp` and `uuid` are **reserved** and behave like `slug`.
  Treat any unknown value as `slug`.
- `language.ui` for user-facing prompts

If config doesn't exist, use defaults listed above.

Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-archive/SKILL.md` if it exists —
project-specific overrides take priority over general instructions.

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Extract mode from arguments:

```
(no args)        → interactive mode: scan, show completable plans, ask which to archive
list             → show archive contents, then STOP
--roadmap        → trim closed milestones from ROADMAP.md into a snapshot
--all            → archive ALL completed plans (ask confirmation first)
<plan-name>      → archive a specific plan by filename or partial stem match
```

Parsing rules:

- `list` and `--roadmap` are mutually exclusive with `<plan-name>` and `--all`
- If multiple conflicting modes are given, emit error and STOP
- `<plan-name>` can be:
  - full filename: `0005_feature-auth.md`
  - ultra directory/entrypoint: `0005_feature-auth` or `0005_feature-auth/index.md`
  - stem without extension: `0005_feature-auth`
  - partial match: `feature-auth` (must match exactly one plan)

### Step 2: Execute Mode

---

#### Mode: Interactive (no arguments)

1. Scan `paths.plans/` for root `*.md` files and direct child `*/index.md`
   candidates using `Glob`. Exclude the resolved `paths.plan` and
   `paths.fix_plan`; count a directory only when its entrypoint declares
   `<!-- aif:plan-mode:ultra -->`. Do not treat phase files or unrelated directories as plans.
2. For each artifact, read the entrypoint's `## Tasks` section.
3. Determine completion: a plan is **completed** when ALL task checkboxes
   are `- [x]`. Plans with any `- [ ]` are incomplete.
4. If no completed plans found:
   ```
   No completed plans found in <paths.plans/>.
   ```
   → STOP.
5. Display completed plans:
   ```
   Completed plans ready to archive:

     1. 0001_feature-alpha.md (completed 2026-05-20)
     2. 0003_feature-gamma.md (completed 2026-05-24)

   Incomplete plans (skipped):
     - 0005_feature-delta.md (3/7 tasks done)
   ```
6. Ask which to archive:
   ```
   AskUserQuestion: Which plans to archive?

   Options:
   1. All completed plans listed above
   2. Select specific plans (enter numbers)
   3. Cancel
   ```
7. Execute archive operation for selected plans (see **Archive Operation**).

---

#### Mode: `list`

1. Check if `<paths.archive>/plans/` exists.
2. If not: `Archive is empty. No plans have been archived yet.` → STOP.
3. Glob root `<paths.archive>/plans/*.md` files and direct child
   `<paths.archive>/plans/*/index.md` entrypoints containing exactly one
   `<!-- aif:plan-mode:ultra -->`.
4. For each archived artifact, extract its date from YAML frontmatter (full
   plans) or `<!-- aif:archived:YYYY-MM-DD -->` immediately after the ultra
   marker (`index.md`).
5. Display:
   ```
   Archived plans (<paths.archive>/plans/):

     1. 0001_feature-alpha.md  (archived: 2026-05-20)
     2. 0003_feature-gamma.md  (archived: 2026-05-24)

   Total: 2 archived plans
   ```
6. Check `<paths.archive>/roadmap/` for snapshots and list them if present:
   ```
   Roadmap snapshots (<paths.archive>/roadmap/):

     1. 2026-05-20_roadmap-snapshot.md (3 milestones)
   ```
7. STOP.

---

#### Mode: `<plan-name>`

1. Resolve `<plan-name>` to one artifact in `paths.plans/`:
   - Try exact root filename, exact ultra directory, or exact `*/index.md` match
   - Then try with `.md` extension appended
   - Then try partial match against root filenames and ultra directory names
2. If no match: `Plan not found: <plan-name>` with suggestions → STOP.
3. If multiple matches: list them and ask user to be more specific → STOP.
4. For a directory match, read the entrypoint and require
   `<!-- aif:plan-mode:ultra -->`;
   otherwise it is not an archivable AI Factory plan.
5. Read the matched entrypoint and check completion status.
6. If incomplete:
   ```
   Plan <filename> is not completed (5/8 tasks done).
   Only completed plans can be archived.
   ```
   → STOP.
7. Execute archive operation (see **Archive Operation**).

---

#### Mode: `--all`

1. Scan `paths.plans/` for completed plans (same logic as interactive mode).
2. If no completed plans: inform and STOP.
3. Display list and ask confirmation:
   ```
   AskUserQuestion: Archive ALL completed plans?

     1. 0001_feature-alpha.md
     2. 0003_feature-gamma.md

   Options:
   1. Yes, archive all 2 plans
   2. Cancel
   ```
4. Execute archive operation for all confirmed plans.

---

#### Mode: `--roadmap`

1. Read the resolved `paths.roadmap` file.
2. If it doesn't exist: `No ROADMAP.md found at <path>.` → STOP.
3. Find milestones with `- [x]` checkbox (completed milestones).
4. If no completed milestones: `No closed milestones to archive.` → STOP.
5. Display and ask confirmation:
   ```
   Closed milestones found in ROADMAP.md:

     - [x] MVP Launch — core features shipped
     - [x] Beta Testing — user feedback round

   AskUserQuestion: Trim these milestones from ROADMAP.md into a snapshot?

   Options:
   1. Yes, create snapshot and trim
   2. Cancel
   ```
6. Create snapshot:
   - `mkdir -p <paths.archive>/roadmap/`
   - Determine snapshot filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_roadmap-snapshot.md`
   - **Collision check.** Before writing, verify the destination does not already exist:
     ```
     Read <paths.archive>/roadmap/YYYY-MM-DD_roadmap-snapshot.md
     ```
     If the file exists, append a counter suffix to produce a non-colliding name:
     `YYYY-MM-DD_roadmap-snapshot-2.md`, `YYYY-MM-DD_roadmap-snapshot-3.md`, etc.
     Check each candidate until a free name is found.
   - Write the resolved snapshot path with:
     ```markdown
     # Roadmap Snapshot — YYYY-MM-DD

     Archived from: <paths.roadmap>

     ## Archived Milestones

     - [x] MVP Launch — core features shipped
     - [x] Beta Testing — user feedback round
     ```
7. Edit `paths.roadmap`: remove the archived `- [x]` lines from the
   `## Milestones` section. Keep the `## Completed` table if it exists.
   **Do NOT edit `paths.roadmap` unless the snapshot write in step 6 succeeded.**
8. Logging: `INFO [aif-archive] roadmap snapshot: <resolved-path> (<N> milestones archived)`

### Archive Operation (plans)

For each plan artifact to archive:

1. `mkdir -p <paths.archive>/plans/`

2. **Collision check.** Before moving, verify the destination does not already exist:
   ```
   Read <paths.archive>/plans/<original-name>          # full plan
   Read <paths.archive>/plans/<original-name>/index.md # ultra bundle
   ```
   If the file exists:
   - **Single plan** (interactive or `<plan-name>`): STOP with an error:
     ```
     ERROR [aif-archive] destination already exists: <paths.archive>/plans/<filename>
     A previously archived plan has the same filename. This can happen when
     sequential numbering reuses a freed number after archiving.
     To resolve: rename the existing archive file, or delete it if it is no
     longer needed.
     ```
   - **Batch** (`--all`): SKIP this plan with a warning, continue to the next:
     ```
     WARN [aif-archive] skipped: <filename> — destination already exists
     ```
   Do NOT overwrite in either case.

3. **Validate an ultra bundle before moving it.** Read `index.md` and require:
   - exactly one `<!-- aif:plan-mode:ultra -->`, as the first line or immediately
     after an optional first-line `<!-- handoff:task:<id> -->`;
   - a non-empty `## Phase Index`;
   - every linked phase path is a direct child of the bundle and exists.

   A malformed bundle is not safe to archive. STOP for a single plan, or emit
   `WARN [aif-archive] skipped malformed ultra bundle: <filename>` and continue
   in `--all` mode.

4. **Move the complete source artifact** into the archive path first:
   ```bash
   mv <paths.plans>/<name> <paths.archive>/plans/<name>
   ```
   For ultra, `<name>` is the whole directory, so all linked phase files move
   together. This atomically removes the plan from active discovery.

5. **Add archive metadata** to the moved entrypoint using `Edit` (`index.md` for
   ultra, the moved plan file otherwise).

   For ultra, preserve the canonical header and insert this comment immediately
   after `<!-- aif:plan-mode:ultra -->`:
   ```markdown
   <!-- aif:archived:YYYY-MM-DD -->
   ```
   Never prepend YAML or move the ultra marker: it must remain the first line or
   immediately after an optional first-line Handoff annotation.

   For a full plan, if the file already has YAML frontmatter (between `---`
   markers at the top):
   - Use `Edit` to add `archived: YYYY-MM-DD` field inside the existing frontmatter block.

   If the full plan has no YAML frontmatter:
   - Use `Edit` to prepend a minimal frontmatter block before the first line:
     ```yaml
     ---
     archived: YYYY-MM-DD
     ---
     ```

   The original filename or directory name is preserved exactly, including any
   sequential `NNNN_` prefix.

6. Logging: `INFO [aif-archive] archived: <filename> -> <paths.archive>/plans/<filename>`

7. After all plans are processed, display summary:
   ```
   ## Archive Complete

   Archived N plan(s) to <paths.archive>/plans/:
     - 0001_feature-alpha.md
     - 0003_feature-gamma.md

   Skipped: K (destination already exists)
     - 0002_feature-beta.md

   Plans directory: <paths.plans/> (M plans remaining)
   ```
   Omit the "Skipped" section when K is 0.

### Completion Detection Algorithm

A plan is **completed** when:

1. The plan entrypoint contains a `## Tasks` section (case-insensitive header match).
2. ALL lines matching the pattern `- [x]` or `- [ ]` within the Tasks section
   (and its subsections) are checked: every checkbox is `- [x]`.
3. If the Tasks section contains zero checkboxes, the plan is considered
   **not completed** (empty plans are not archivable).

Edge cases:

- Checkboxes outside `## Tasks` (e.g., in `## Settings` or `## Commit Plan`)
  are NOT counted for completion.
- Nested checkboxes (indented `  - [x]`) ARE counted.
- Plans whose entrypoint lacks `## Tasks` are not archivable — emit
  `WARN [aif-archive] <name> has no ## Tasks section; skipping`.

### Completion Date Inference

When displaying "completed" dates in interactive mode:

1. Check YAML frontmatter for a `completed` field — use if present.
2. Fall back to git: `git log -1 --format=%ai -- <plan-file>` to get last
   modification date.
3. Fall back to filesystem: entrypoint modification time.

## Important Rules

1. **Never archive incomplete plans** — all tasks must be `- [x]`
2. **Always ask confirmation** before `--all` and `--roadmap` operations
3. **Preserve original file/directory names** — including sequential `NNNN_` prefix
4. **Add archive metadata** — YAML frontmatter for full plans; the stable
   `<!-- aif:archived:YYYY-MM-DD -->` comment after the ultra marker for bundles
5. **Do not modify fast plans** (`paths.plan`) or fix plans (`paths.fix_plan`) —
   those are single-file artifacts managed by `$aif-implement` and `$aif-fix`
6. **Do not count archived plans for sequential numbering** — archived plans
   live in `paths.archive/plans/`, not `paths.plans/`, so `$aif-plan`
   sequential scan does not include them

## Artifact Ownership

- **Owns:** `paths.archive/plans/*.md`, archived ultra bundle directories, and `paths.archive/roadmap/*.md`
- **Reads:** root `paths.plans/*.md`, direct child ultra `*/index.md` + linked phases, and `paths.roadmap`
- **Modifies:** `paths.roadmap` (only with `--roadmap`, only after confirmation)
- **Does NOT touch:** `paths.plan`, `paths.fix_plan`, `paths.description`,
  `paths.architecture`, `paths.rules_file`
